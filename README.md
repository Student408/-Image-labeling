# Image Classification Dataset

Welcome to the Image Classification Dataset repository! This repository contains a versatile dataset suitable for image classification tasks across various domains. Whether you're working on medical diagnosis, object recognition, or satellite imagery analysis, this dataset provides a diverse collection of labeled images to support your research and development efforts.

## Overview

The dataset comprises images categorized into multiple classes, representing distinct objects, conditions, or categories of interest. These classes cover a wide range of domains and applications, making the dataset suitable for a variety of machine learning and computer vision tasks.

## Usage

Researchers, developers, and practitioners in the field of computer vision and machine learning can leverage this dataset for training, validating, and evaluating image classification models. The labeled images facilitate supervised learning tasks, enabling the development of robust algorithms across different domains.

### Example Usage in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Load training data
feats_train = np.load("/path/to/feats_train.npy")
labels_train = np.load("/path/to/labels_train.npy")

# Load testing data
feats_test = np.load("/path/to/feats_test.npy")
labels_test = np.load("/path/to/labels_test.npy")

# Now you can use feats_train, labels_train, feats_test, and labels_test for training and testing your machine learning models.
```

## File Structure

The dataset is organized into training and testing sets, with images stored in directories corresponding to their respective classes. Additionally, auxiliary files such as numpy arrays containing image features and labels are provided for easy integration into machine learning pipelines.
