# Image Classification Dataset

Welcome to the Image Classification Dataset repository! This repository contains a versatile dataset suitable for image classification tasks across various domains. Whether you're working on medical diagnosis, object recognition, or satellite imagery analysis, this dataset provides a diverse collection of labeled images to support your research and development efforts.

## Overview

The dataset comprises images categorized into multiple classes, representing distinct objects, conditions, or categories of interest. These classes cover a wide range of domains and applications, making the dataset suitable for a variety of machine learning and computer vision tasks.

## Usage

Researchers, developers, and practitioners in the field of computer vision and machine learning can leverage this dataset for training, validating, and evaluating image classification models. The labeled images facilitate supervised learning tasks, enabling the development of robust algorithms across different domains.

### Example Usage in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Load training data
feats_train = np.load("/path/to/feats_train.npy")
labels_train = np.load("/path/to/labels_train.npy")

# Load testing data
feats_test = np.load("/path/to/feats_test.npy")
labels_test = np.load("/path/to/labels_test.npy")

# Now you can use feats_train, labels_train, feats_test, and labels_test for training and testing your machine learning models.
```

Sure, here's an example of how you could structure a README.md file for your GitHub repository:

# Skin Cancer Image Classification Dataset

This repository contains a dataset for skin cancer image classification. The dataset consists of images of skin lesions categorized into different classes, suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models for skin cancer classification tasks.

## Overview

The dataset is sourced from the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset and is organized into the following classes:

- Basal Cell Carcinoma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Benign Keratosis
- No Cancer

Each class contains images collected from various sources, labeled accordingly to the type of skin lesion.

## Usage

You can use this dataset to train machine learning models for skin cancer classification tasks. Here's how you can load and use the dataset in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Load training data
feats_train = np.load("/content/drive/My Drive/skin_cancer_dataset/check_points/feats_train.npy")
labels_train = np.load("/content/drive/My Drive/skin_cancer_dataset/check_points/labels_train.npy")

# Load testing data
feats_test = np.load("/content/drive/My Drive/skin_cancer_dataset/check_points/feats_test.npy")
labels_test = np.load("/content/drive/My Drive/skin_cancer_dataset/check_points/labels_test.npy")

# Now you can use feats_train, labels_train, feats_test, and labels_test for training and testing your machine learning models.
```

## File Structure
